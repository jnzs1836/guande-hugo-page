Hi! This am Guande Wu, a Ph.D. candidate in Tandon School of Engineering, New York University. My advisor is [Prof. Claudio T. Silva](https://vgc.poly.edu/~csilva/) and I am also working with [Prof. Chen Zhao](http://www.chenz.umiacs.io).  My research is centered around creating intent-driven human-AI collaborative systems across various application domains, including augmented reality (AR) and multi-modal analysis. I’m particularly interested in exploring how multi-modal LLM agents can collaborate with humans as equal partners.

Previously, I’ve had the opportunity to work with many outstanding experts in visualization and multi-modal LLM at Zhejiang University, Tongji University, UC Davis, Microsoft Research Asia, Adobe Research and Amazon AWS AI. I have also served as the PC member for Chinese CHI and the reviewer for ACM CHI, UIST, CVPR, AAAI, IMWUT, TPAMI and TVCG.
*I’ll be on the job market next year, seeking opportunities in both the U.S. and China.*
