Hi! This am Guande Wu, a Ph.D. candidate in Tandon School of Engineering, New York University. My advisor is [Prof. Claudio T. Silva](https://vgc.poly.edu/~csilva/). My research is centered around creating intent-driven human-AI collaborative systems across various application domains, including augmented reality (AR) and multi-modal analysis. I’m particularly interested in exploring how multi-modal large language model (LLM) agents can collaborate with humans as equal partners.
Previously, I have worked with many outstanding experts in visualization and multi-modal LLM at Zhejiang University, Tongji University, UC Davis, Microsoft Research Asia, Adobe Research and Amazon AWS AI. *I’ll be on the job market next year, seeking opportunities in both the U.S. and China.*
